* [Lint][]ing for code validation. There are various "linters" available on the web; an example is [JSLint][]. If you use JSLint, a formatter such as [JSBeautifier][] is helpful because JSLint contains formatting rules that must be met in order to check for errors. The [JSLint Error Explanations] site explains issues raised by linters as well as ways to adjust the JavaScript to avoid the issues.
