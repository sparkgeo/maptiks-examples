## Getting Started with Finder
Finder is a configurable ArcGIS Online application that searches and queries attributes of feature layers. It can be used to present information about a wide variety of features such as property tax and assessment information or the locations of water access points.

This application can be deployed by local, state, and national governments; utilities; NGOs and private industries; and can be used by staff or citizens on desktop computers, smartphones, and tablet devices.
