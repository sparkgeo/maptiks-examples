## Getting Started with Find, Edit, and Filter
Find, Edit, and Filter is a configurable ArcGIS Online application that searches and queries attributes of feature layers. The application provides the ability to search for features within the map, uses the configurable default attribute to interactively filter visible content in the map, and populates the default attribute based on the current filter value during editing workflows.

This application can be deployed by local, state, and national governments; utilities; NGOs as well as private industries; and can be used by staff or citizens on desktop computers, smartphones, and tablet devices.
