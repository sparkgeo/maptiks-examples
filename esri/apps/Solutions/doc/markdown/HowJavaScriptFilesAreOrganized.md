## How the JavaScript Files are Organized

### Structure

The app uses [AMD][] modules for maximum compatibility with the ArcGIS API for JavaScript and with the Dojo Toolkit. Virtually all of the JavaScript is stored in files rather than in the launching HTML; this is done to maximize browser caching and thus speed.
* jsonlineStart.js contains the code to launch the app.
* jsonlineBuildUI.js contains two classes -- LGUIBuilder and LGArcGISAccess -- for building the user interface.
* jsonlineApp.js contains (directly for online or through references in the download) the classes that LGUIBuilder uses in the user interface.

lgonlineStart.js and lgonlineBuildUI.js are kept separate to maximize parallel access to the server during app startup.

### Documentation

All JavaScript is documented using [JSDoc][] tags so that code documentation may be automatically generated. The documentation may be accessed [here][javascript code doc].

### Validation

In order to help catch typographic errors, all JavaScript & JSON in the repository is validated except for third-party libraries. See the [Resources][] page for information about validation.

### Compression

The app is set up so that it can run using either uncompressed or compressed JavaScript, and so that the compressed version may be generated by automatic tools from the uncompressed version. The uncompressed version is used for the app's download; the compressed version is used for the ArcGIS Online-hosted app site. The compressed [js2/ folder][] is less than 30% the size of the uncompressed version.
